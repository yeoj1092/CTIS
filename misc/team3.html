<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>[Note: Your individual and unique perspective on the topic/issue].</em></h4><br>

<p>The revolution of artificial intelligence has a variety of advantages however, from an ethical 
perspective, there are a variety of concerns to think about as well. In an ethical perspective, questions 
that arise in relation to artificial intelligence more so relate come from whether or not it would 
affect human life in the near future. Questions such as the possibility of human workers being replaced 
by AI machinery, AI advancing to a point where machines start to develop emotions and gain rights of 
their own, and questioning the extent of trust we can have in these machines. If we don’t ask ourselves 
these questions, down the road this can have a negative impact for the future of our society. </p>

<p>Ethical concerns for society regarding artificial intelligence are presented in the role of human 
trust such as self-driving cars. Tesla Motors is an autonomous electric vehicle which uses autopilot 
technology and many other AI features (Tesla,n.d). The first concern here is seeing humans allow a system 
to take control. One Tesla model in particular, the Tesla model 3 had played a significant role in a fatal
 crash in Southern California. The main cause of the crash was in relation to the Tesla model 3’s autopilot 
 system being activated (Gregg,2021). Another concerning example is the lack of privacy and surveillance towards 
 society. As facial recognition technologies continue to advance and develop in detecting areas in the public 
 without people's permission(Budds,2018), the potential drawback within this case increases the threat of one's 
 privacy being vulnerable to data theft and private information being leaked. Additionally, as machines progress 
 with the implementations of emotions and rights, what is likely to happen?</p>
 
 <p>I think machines can be intelligent without the need of emotions. They don't get fatigued or paid and 
 can pretty much operate when needed. With the use of AI it should be clear on the restriction of developing 
 for the safety of our people. My take from the concerns of AI use and development are based on what I’ve 
 seen in movies. For instance, the movie “I,Robot” shows the possible dangers of how the laws of robotics 
 have been violated resulting in turning against humanity (Imdb,n.d).
