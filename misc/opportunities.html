<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

<p>The opportunities of Artificial Intelligence(AI) have provided the expectation of benefiting our society today. Over the 
years inventors and scientists have challenged machines with the ability to think. Whether machines can presently ‘think’ is 
now no longer surprising(Baecker,2019). Artificial intelligence technology has  progressively become important and more demanding 
in creating new opportunities. We will be discussing how (AI) is applied to our daily lives as it is poised to dramatically 
improve efficiency and productivity. </p>

<p>Automation has had an effect with the reduction of human effort with the relations of machines programmed to carry out a 
task or job. As a result, automations can eliminate the need to perform tedious tasks considering the effect on work and 
jobs. Automated systems can be used to tackle such repetitive and replicated tasks. Many business owners already use a form 
of automations for example, companies such as Mitsubishi Motors who are the 9th largest worldwide by production, specialise in 
the automotive industry (Wikipedia,n.d). With their partnering company, Mitshubish electric has introduced “ LoadMate Plus “which 
is aimed towards manufactures as an automated machine tool that helps with labor. It is a task that removes parts, then mounts 
between two machines with the use of robotics(Illinois,2021). According to Hills (2021), Brodecki who is a services product manager 
at Mitsubishi Electric Automations mentions that automation solutions for machines heavily rely on mechanical robots and cobots for 
adjustability when it comes to performance and need of bigger parts. A prime example of (AI) use today is self driving cars. Elon Musk, 
co-founder and CEO of Tesla Motors has developed an autonomous electric vehicle which uses autopilot technology (Wikipedia,n.d). The 
technology they use is built on a deep neural network, with the help of cameras and sensors to guide the vehicle from your home 
to your destination. Functions within these Tesla vehicles include auto lane change, autopark, the feature to automatically r
etrieve your vehicle as Tesla names ‘Summon’ and traffic light and stop sign control(Tesla,n.d).</p>

<p>(AI) can also be seen in the likes of education. Known as Education Learning, as students are given support outside of their classrooms 
for example, they are provided with online services. In depth, artificial intelligence programs are built to make intelligent tutors with 
the aim to support student learning such as identifying what students are struggling with and adapting tutoring solutions based 
on results(Baecker,2019). (AI) also opens opportunities for adults to carry on in education by providing them with automated admin 
tasks, systems to assess work, identifying skills and creating support systems(Schaffhauser,2020). In regards to automated admin 
tasks, it is noticed that educators spend a lot of time checking up on work, grading tests overall becoming overwhelmed with repetitive 
tasks. The process of applying automation software will save a significant amount of time. By doing this, it will completely remove 
much of manual paperwork(airSlate,2020). A significant example for the use of identifying skills, Carnegie Learning is a source 
that assists and enables  educators to cater to all their students without having to focus on them individually (Carnegie Learning,n.d). This 
source provides service for students and educators to interact with tutors who can offer them a better and easier understanding on topics 
they may be struggling with. Fortunately for both students and educators, Carnegie Learning offers educational services for all subjects 
resulting in a broad service of identifying skills (Carnegie Learning,n.d).</p>

<p>(AI) is becoming more present in modern business and everyday life and it is also steadily being applied to healthcare. Although 
healthcare has progressed over time, there are still some global challenges mainly in the increased number of people in need of care. Global 
challenges include medical services for the elderly, creating medicine for new emerging illnesses and providing medical care for patients with 
long term health conditions (Ministry of Health,2018). Contrary to that issue, the help of AI and robotics healthcare is being transformed 
in many aspects. For instance, a health application and medical device named The Internet of Medical Things(IoMT) uses networking 
technology to obtain health care information in guiding  patients to doctors in providing medical services and planning which can be 
more efficient and reduce costs (Joyia et al., 2017). Noticeably, technology applications and apps are helping individuals in providing 
knowledge to proactively manage a healthy lifestyle. In addition to healthcare, early detection software has been developed which helps 
predict symptoms or patients who are at risk of developing a condition. This will significantly help doctors to observe the most at risk 
to potentially develop life-threatening diseases (Griffiths,S.2016). This is only possible with machine learning to input extensive amounts 
of data to a well-defined output to practitioners with that leading down to decision making. Decision making is another area where AI is 
beginning to gain momentum in the field of medicine as it needs algorithms that can learn by themselves. The involvement of AI in this area 
helps by understanding the capabilities of physicians which require supercomputers(Mesko,2017). </p>

<p>Overall, the opportunities AI provides can be seen in automation, having it become very efficient with increasing productivity in 
businesses as well as advancing and developing towards education and healthcare making it useful and easy to understand. It is deemed 
revolutionary that machines can think and perform tasks the same way as humans seeing that it provides a lot of value to everyday life.
