<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>
Artificial intelligence is transforming every aspect of our life in this day and age, including agriculture, security, 
manufacturing, inventories, healthcare, retail, and many more. There are numerous advantages to employing AI, including 
automation, smarter decision making, research, solving complex problems, minimizing errors, and many others. Artificial 
intelligence is always evolving, and it has the potential to be smarter than ever before. While it is impossible to 
predict the future of AI, it will surely continue to help businesses and end-users in their daily lives. 
(Where Is Artificial Intelligence Used: Areas Where AI Can Be Used, 2021)</p>

<p>With so many advantages to artificial intelligence, there are also numerous ethical issues to consider, such as job 
automation, wealth disparity based on individuals who own AI-driven enterprises, AI bias from biased training data 
provided, and the most common privacy breach. The reason for the privacy violation is because Artificial Intelligence 
requires big data collection for training reasons, and access to those data sets might raise concerns about data 
protection. (Stahl B. C. 2021)</p>

<p>An example of privacy violation is the case of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. In 2014, Aleksandr Kogan, a University 
of Cambridge researcher, created the Facebook app "This is your digital life," which collected personal data from its 
users. Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, later purchased the app from Kogan in order to develop voter 
profiles and assist target political adverts. Furthermore, users of the app were not advised that their data would be 
utilized for political objectives. At the time, Facebook permitted apps made by third-party developers to acquire data 
on its users' entire social networks without their express agreement. This allowed Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to 
obtain personal information from 87 million Facebook users, despite the fact that only 270,000 people had downloaded 
the program. (Library Guides: History C184D: Human Contexts and Ethics of Data: Cambridge Analytica, 2021) This 
demonstrates to the user that there will always be a trace of personal data that can be exploited.</p>

<p>For this to work with the user, the companies collecting the personal data must be transparent with the user when using 
their services, such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, as they would have collected large amounts of personal data from 
the user over time, such as location, family, search history, and other personal information. While it may say that it 
does not sell any information about its users or customers, this does not imply that the company does not share it with 
others. As previously mentioned, Facebook did not sell any personal information to Cambridge Analytica. Rather, it allowed 
a researcher to utilize an app to collect data, which was then forwarded to the analytics company. (Morse, 2018) Furthermore, 
any data gathered will be used either constructively, such as personal user experience, or negatively, and will be exploited. 
This is entirely dependent on the user.</p>
