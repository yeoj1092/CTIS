<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


<ul><h2><li>AI system Bias and discrimination:</li></h2>
<p> AI systems learn to draw inferences from training data, which may include biassed human decisions<br>
or reflect historical or social disparities, even when sensitive variables such as gender, ethnicity,<br>
or sexual orientation are not included. (What Do We Do About the Biases in AI? 2021)</p>

<ul><li><h3>The Amazon hiring algorithm</li>
<p>This example of AI Bias came in the form of "reviewing job applicants' resumes with the aim of mechanizing the search for top talents"(Dastin, 2021) 
in the Amazon hiring algorithm. Their goal was to use artificial intelligence to provide a score for job candidates from which they could select the 
top percentage of those who applied. From an engineer who spoke to Reuters, "They literally wanted it to be an engine where I’m going 
to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we’ll hire those." (Dastin, 2021).</p>
<p>By 2015, however, the corporation found that its new approach was not ranking candidates for software developer jobs and other technical positions in a 
gender-neutral manner. Over a ten-year period, the artificial intelligence system was trained using data provided by applicants. Men constituted a sizable 
proportion of those. The system effectively taught itself that male candidates were preferable, reflecting male dominance in the tech industry, according 
to the report. (Amazon scrapped 'sexist AI' tool, 2021) </p>
<p>In effect, it penalized resumes that used the phrase "women's." As a result, graduates from two all-women’s universities were degraded, according to 
people familiar with the situation. Amazon later modified the scripts to make them insensitive to these words. However, there was no guarantee that the 
machines would not discover other methods of categorizing candidates that could be discriminatory. (Dastin, 2021). </p>


</ul>
<li><h2>Privacy violations</li></h2>
<p>All of our digital footprints leave an online data trail. Phone records, credit card transactions, location sharing, browsing history, shopping history, 
emails, conversations, posts, and the list goes on. Almost every online activity will leave a trail of data for service providers to collect. 
(Why is Privacy important?, 2021)What makes artificial intelligence more superior to humans in collecting pieces of information is broken down into three 
categories which are speed, scale, and automation. The pace at which AI computes is already quicker than that of human analysts, and it may be arbitrarily 
improved by adding additional hardware. Finally, AI may complete the assigned tasks without supervision, considerably increasing analytical efficiency.
(AI and the Future of Privacy, 2021)</p>

<ul><li><h3>Google</li>
<p>An example of a privacy violation is Google. Google is considered a tech giant where it knows a lot about its users. It knows the user’s lives, location, 
work, family, route, daily activities, websites, balance, and many more. Aside from the obvious invasion of privacy, it does not keep the data to itself. 
The data is gathered, processed, and, most importantly, sold to third-party organizations with whom the user may or may not be comfortable sharing their 
personal information. Data exploitation is not new, but as we anticipate more from our mobile devices, our data becomes the currency through which tech 
businesses profit. (www.dw.com), 2021).</p>

<li><h3>Amazon</li>
<p>Another example is Amazon Personalize where it states that "Amazon Personalize can provide recommendations based on a user's browsing context." 
(What is Amazon Personalize? -Amazon Personalize, 2021) Even though this might be a benefit for most user experience, it tracks the users' "browsing 
context" and Amazon can and does share some of your personal information with any third parties engaged in your transactions. But Amazon's Privacy 
Notice states that the corporation is "not in the business of selling [our] customers' personal information to others." Instead, Amazon uses the 
information it collects to better understand who you are and then recommend things that you might be interested in.
(Does Amazon Sell Your Personal Information? -DeleteMe, 2021)</p>
</ul>

<li><h2>Destructive method for achieving its goal</li></h2>
<p>Although artificial intelligence (AI) can be beneficial to current society through technological advancement, it can also develop a destructive method 
for achieving its goal whenever we fail to fully align the ai's goal with ours, which is extremely difficult. As an example, consider If a superintelligent 
machine is tasked with a large-scale geoengineering project, it may wreak havoc on our biosphere as a byproduct, and regard human attempts to stop it as a 
danger that must be met. Another possibility is that if you order an obedient intelligent car to transport you to the airport as quickly as possible, it 
will do it while being followed by helicopters and covered in vomit, doing not what you wanted but actually what you asked for. (Benefits & Risks of 
Artificial Intelligence - Future of Life Institute, 2021) </p>
