<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>[Note: Your individual and unique perspective on the topic/issue].</em></h4><br>
     <p>
        Artificial Intelligence today are already making important decisions in multiple aspects of human life, such as whether someone should be hired, or who has the most urgent needs in a hospital. The AI learns how to do this
        from real world data, which can be influenced by things such as racial or gender bias, and as such it can also malfunction when it comes across unfamiliar scenarios. The reality is, as mentioned by Shaw (2019), that
        AI currently are very fragile compared to human-intelligence. <br /><br />

        There are a few ethical issues relating to Artificial Intelligence, such as the obtaining of data without the knowledge of the consumer, using AI to manipulate the behavior of the consumer, and amplifying a bias 
        that may already be present in a set of data. I want to focus on the issue of obtaining data without the knowledge of the user.<br/><br/>
        Many phones have facial recognition, which uses an AI to unlock your phone or files. This creates the illusion that we as consumers have control over who can see our phones, tablets, etc. This is true. However, by creating a facial recognition, 
        we leave behind a plethora of data for big companies to use and exploit in methods such as facial profiling and tracking. The main idea behind gaming and social media is to keep people interacting, and 
        leaving their data. This is known sometimes as "Surveillance Capitalism". Müller (2020) also mentions that we have lost ownership of our data.<br/><br/>

         I think that companies should be made to be more transparent with how they are obtaining their data, and what they are using their data ofr. If companies were to come forward with their plans, it would be easier 
        for consumers to trust them and would provide more incentive to purchase their products. Through researching the topic of Artificial Intelligence, there are many benefits, and risks, along with a plethora of ways 
        we can choose to develop AI for the future, I believe if we continue on this path, with companies using manipulation tactics and deceit, they will not be able to thrive in the new age, as we will find ways to secure
        our data, or at least entrust our data to other parties who are transparent with their intentions.
