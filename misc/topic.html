<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>


</ul><h5><p>
    Since the world is rapidly developing in terms of technology, simple AI is becoming more common.
    In order to better develop AI, we need a stronger understanding of what an AI can do for us as a society.
    This website is meant to be a resource to help people understand not only the opportunities AI provides,
    but also the risks, and the choices we can make from those.
