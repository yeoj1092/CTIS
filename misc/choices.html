    </ul><h4><p>
    When thinking about our choices with Artificial Intelligence, the choices we have are essentially only limited by our current capabilities.<br>
    We can develop deep learning systems that allows the systems to collaborate with each other, mimicking the human learning.<br />
    We can develop machine learning systems to require a smaller number of examples to train the machine learning algorithm.<br /><br />

    “Misaligned or confused and conflated goals of an AI are going to be a significant concern of the future, as the AI will be extremely good at achieving its goals, but those goals may not represent what we wanted.”<br /><br />

    One choice we must make is to develop the machine learning systems to where an AI can explain the logic behind their judgement. 
    By doing so we then become able to understand where the algorithm fails and correct this. 
    Once that is achieved, we can look at instances where a human may not need to be present, and the AI judgement becomes more trustworthy.
