# Project Portfolio: Impact of Technology Site

This project is part of Impact of Technology Site. The goal of the project is to explore the use and potential impact of artificial intelligence.

As part of the project, you will be required to submit both a team assignment and an individual assignment. The team assignment will consist of a zip file containing all of your team's assignment files and folders, including a soft copy of your team website. The individual assignment will consist of two zip files, one containing a completed html file of your peer evaluation page and the other containing a copy of your team website with embedded ethical reflections.

All assignments should be submitted both to the online repository hosted on github.io and in a soft copy on school site. Please follow the submission instructions provided in the assignment prompt carefully to ensure that your work is properly submitted and can be reviewed by the instructor.
